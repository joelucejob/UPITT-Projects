Academic project created in ADA to recreate the game reversi. 
Each player gets a turn to place a piece. 
Black player can only place black pieces while the white player places white pieces.
If a row, column, or diagonal is surrounded by a particular color, it will convert that row, column, diagonal, to that color.
After all spaces ran out on the board, the player with the most pieces on the board wins.
